2008-01-01 01:32:37,"UPDATE 1-U.S. and Britain pressure Kenya over disputed poll"," (Adds Amnesty International statement)      By Daniel Wallis      NAIROBI, Jan 1 (Reuters) - The United States and Britain  pressed Kenya to investigate possible voting irregularities in  an election that returned President Mwai Kibaki to power and  triggered rioting in which more than 100 people have died.      The death toll appeared certain to rise after Kibaki's  disputed victory in East Africa's biggest economy.      International observers who initially hailed the poll as an  example for the continent expressed serious concerns about the  vote-counting and abhorred the nationwide clashes that followed.      The United States said on Monday disputes over the poll  should be resolved through 'constitutional and legal remedies'  and that it was working with all parties to avoid more violence.      'All sides should exercise and work for a solution that  reflects the will of the Kenyan people,' said a spokesman for  British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, who spoke to Kibaki and  opposition leader Raila Odinga and urged them to work together.      Reuters estimates about 100 people have been killed, based  on witnesses, body counts and credible media reports of the  battles between police and machete-wielding protesters.      Residents said bodies still lay on some streets of Kisumu, a  city in the opposition's western heartland. Local television  station KTN said the nationwide toll had reached at least 124.      The violence in the capital Nairobi, the Indian Ocean resort  of Mombasa and many smaller towns put investment in the economy  at risk and dented Kenya's image as a haven of relative  stability in an often dangerous region.      U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon deplored the bloodshed  and urged security forces to show the utmost restraint.      Amnesty International called for an independent inquiry into  the killings. 'The government should ensure its security forces  comply with international standards on the use of lethal force  against demonstrators,' the rights group said in a statement.            KIBAKI MESSAGE      In a New Year message, Kibaki urged reconciliation but  promised to deal decisively with any troublemakers.      Much of the fighting has pitted members of his Kikuyu ethnic  group, Kenya's largest and most economically dominant tribe,  against Luo supporters of opposition leader Raila Odinga.      As many people stayed at home in fear, most businesses  remained closed and supplies of food, fuel and water ran low.      The worst violence has been in Kisumu, where witnesses said  police fired on protesters when riots erupted on Sunday.      On Monday, 21 bodies lay at a Kisumu mortuary. Most had  gunshot wounds. Verifying the toll was hard because reporters  were barred by a man who said he was a government employee.      The government said it would not declare a state of  emergency or any curfews, and would not deploy the military.  'Police are handling the matter and the government expects the  situation to normalise in the next few days,' a statement said.      Odinga, who says he is Kenya's elected leader, has called  for a million supporters to gather for a rally in a central  Nairobi park on Thursday.      Both sides have accused the other of blatant rigging during  the Dec. 27 poll, which passed off peacefully. Early tallies  showed Odinga ahead but official final results that were delayed  three days showed Kibaki winning narrowly.      Chief European Union monitor Alexander Graf Lambsdorff said  t"
2008-01-01 01:59:43,"UPDATE 3-Bush signs into law Sudan divestment measure","  (Adds Dodd, Darfur advocacy groups comment)      By Jeremy Pelofsky      CRAWFORD, Texas, Dec 31 (Reuters) - U.S. President George  W. Bush on Monday signed into a law a measure aimed at allowing  states, local governments, mutual funds and pension funds to  divest from Sudan businesses, particularly its oil sectors.      Some 20 U.S. states have initiated divestment efforts  because of the conflict in Sudan's Darfur region, which has  taken some 200,000 lives and displaced some 2.5 million since  rebels took up arms against the government in 2003.      But the effort in Illinois was challenged in court so the  new law seeks to provide a legal framework for divestment from  companies involved in Sudan's oil industry, mineral extraction,  power production and the production of military equipment.      Bush has called the deaths in the Darfur conflict genocide,  a charge the Sudanese government has rejected.      'My administration will continue its efforts to bring about  significant improvements in the conditions in Sudan through  sanctions against the government of Sudan and high-level  diplomatic engagement and by supporting the deployment of  peacekeepers in Darfur,' Bush said in a statement.      But at the same time, he argued some provisions of the new  law could interfere with his ability to conduct foreign policy  and therefore he would 'construe and enforce this legislation  in a manner that does not conflict with that authority.'      White House spokesman Scott Stanzel said the administration  would review divestment policies adopted by states and local  governments to ensure they are consistent with the president's  foreign policy and take action if necessary.      But Stanzel stressed that Bush signed the measure because  'the president broadly agrees with the aim of the sponsors,  that doing business with Sudan should be discouraged.'           STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION      The chief sponsor of the new law, Sen. Chris Dodd, a  Connecticut Democrat and long-shot 2008 presidential hopeful,  said the divestment is a vital step in the right direction.      'As we enter the new year, I urge states and local  governments, as well as private investors, to take action,  exercise your rights under this law and stop the genocide in  Darfur,' Dodd said.      The new law also requires the State and Treasury  Departments to report to Congress on the effectiveness of  sanctions on Sudan. Contractors doing business with the U.S.  government will have to certify they are not involved in those  areas as well.      Bush signed the law at his Texas ranch where he was  spending a weeklong holiday.      The Save Darfur Coalition and other advocacy groups hailed  the signing and urged Bush to ensure the law is enforced.      'The people of Darfur cannot afford an empty 'law on the  books,' which is why the president must vigorously enforce this  critical legislation,' the groups said in a joint statement.       The coalition says the Sudanese government uses up to 70  percent of its oil revenues, generated mainly through foreign  direct investment, to give arms and supplies to the Janjaweed  militia accused of the killings in Darfur.      Activists have pressed investors to divest their holdings  in companies such as Malaysia's state-owned Petronas [PETR.UL],  India's Oil and Natural Gas Corp Ltd <ONGC.BO>, and PetroChina  Co Ltd <0857.HK>, whose parent company, China National  Petroleum Corp, is helping Sudan drill for oil.

2008-01-01 02:10:11,"UPDATE 1-NFL-Ravens sack Billick after disappointing season","    (changes datelines, adds details, quotes)      BALTIMORE, Maryland, Dec 31 (Reuters) - The Baltimore Ravens  sacked long-time head coach Brian Billick on Monday, a day after  finishing a disappointing 5-11 season.      The 53-year-old Billick won a Super Bowl with the Ravens  following the 2000 season but the club went on to win only one  playoff game over the next seven years.      Ravens owner Steve Bisciotti said the firing 'was in the  Ravens' best interest'.      'He (Billick) was very gracious to me when we met today,'  Bisciotti told a news conference. 'He understood, at least gave  me the confidence that I was true to go with my gut.      'I believed it was time for a change. I believe that we have  the nucleus of a team that can get back to the Super Bowl and we  felt that in the next five years we'd have a better chance with a  new coach.'      Billick had spent nine seasons in Baltimore and was the  Ravens' most successful coach with an 85-67 record.      'It has been a great ride with the Ravens and the fans here,'  Billick said in a statement.      'The passion, the dedication and the willingness to work by  the players is so appreciated. Even in this difficult season,  they fought through it.      'My respect for the players, every single one who has played  for the Ravens in the last nine years, is hard to articulate.  They have my complete respect and admiration.'      Billick was brought to Baltimore from Minnesota where he was  the offensive coordinator. However, it was the Ravens' defense  that led them to the Super Bowl and Billick was often criticized  for the team's lagging offense.      One year after winning the AFC North with a 13-3 record, the  Ravens struggled this season, losing a team record nine  consecutive games before a season-ending 27-21 victory over the  Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday.      'He gets a disproportionate amount of blame for the position  that we're in,' Bisciotti said of Billick.       'We are collectively a 5-11 team.'      Bisciotti denied reports he was talking with former Steelers  coach Bill Cowher, who won the Super Bowl following the 2005  campaign, to succeed Billick.      'I have never met Bill Cowher,' he said. 'I have not spent  one minute thinking about Brian's replacement.'

2008-01-01 02:13:02,"Japan births fell in 2007, ageing trend on track","    TOKYO, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Japan is expected to report fewer  babies born in 2007, a government report said on Tuesday, kicking  off the new year with a bleak reminder of the long-term risks the  economy faces as its population ages at an unprecedented pace.      Japan's rock-bottom birth rate has raised concerns about a  shrinking workforce, slower economic growth and troubles ahead  for government efforts to fund its ballooning pension needs.      The Health Ministry report, based on preliminary figures of  births and deaths registered at Japanese municipal offices,  estimated the number of babies born in 2007 was likely to have  fallen by 3,000 from a year earlier to 1,090,000.      The decline would follow an increase in babies in 2006, the  first rise in six years, which was attributed to a rise in  marriages helped by an improving economy.      A ministry official said both births and Japan's population  of 128 million were likely to decline in coming years, given the  outlook for a decline in the number of women able to bear  children.      'The number of babies will probably fall or steady going  forward while the number of deaths will rise,' she said. 'So the  long-term trend is for the population to decline.'      The same report estimated the number of deaths in 2007 rose  by 22,000 to 1,106,000.      Japan's fertility rate, or the average number of children a  woman bears in her lifetime, stood at 1.32 in 2006, far from an  estimated 2.07 needed to keep a population from falling.      Experts say Japan has lagged countries such as Sweden and the  United States in helping parents balance work and family. Long  working hours, late-night business meetings and the high cost of  child care have all put couples off having babies.      The phenomenon threatens to squeeze the economy by shrinking  the labour force and leaving fewer workers to support a growing  number of pensioners.      Separate government data last year showed a tenth of Japan's  population was aged 75 or older, a historical high, while another  report showed the proportion of those 65 or older would double to  40 percent by mid-century.
