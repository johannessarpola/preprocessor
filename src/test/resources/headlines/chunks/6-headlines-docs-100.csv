2008-01-01 03:01:54,"South Korea turns more cautious on 2008 economy","    SEOUL, Jan 1 (Reuters) - South Korea's economy will probably  expand by slightly less than the previously projected 5 percent  in 2008 due to increased risks from the slowing global economy  and firmer oil prices, Finance Minister Kwon O-kyu said.      Kwon said in his New Year news conference, held late last  week for publication on Tuesday, that Asia's fourth-largest  economy would probably expand in 2008 by a similar pace as in  2007, but did not mention a specific rate.      'Our economy in 2008 is expected to grow close to 5 percent,  similar to 2007, with the (year-on-year) growth rate standing  higher in the first half than in the second,' Kwon said.      The central bank estimated in early December that the economy  expanded by a real 4.8 percent in 2007, above its original target  of 4.4 percent set a year earlier but down from a 5.0 percent  rise in 2006.      He said export growth would slightly fall in 2008 due to a  slowing global economy but construction investment growth would  likely pick up, while private consumption and capital investment  will grow at a similar pace as in 2007.      Kwon said his ministry did not set a specific target for the  gross domestic product growth mainly because a new government  will take over in late February, when he and other top government  officials are widely expected to be replaced.      Conservative opposition candidate Lee Myung-bak, a former  Hyundai Group executive, was elected as the country's president   on Dec. 19 to rule the country of nearly 50 million people for a  single five-year term from late February.      He has promised to raise economic growth to 7 percent per  year on average during the next 10 years and lift per capita  income to $40,000 from the current $20,000.      South Korea's economy derives more than half of its annual  defaultOutput from private consumption but has relied heavily on exports  for growth in recent years when consumer spending was growing  only slowly.

2008-01-01 03:08:53,"Convalescing Castro sends Cubans New Year message","    HAVANA, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Convalescing Cuban leader Fidel  Castro on Monday sent a New Year's message telling Cubans to  celebrate the anniversary of his 1959 revolution nearly 17  months after illness forced him to hand power to his brother.      Castro, one of the few surviving Cold War enemies of the  United States, has only appeared in taped videos and  photographs since undergoing emergency stomach surgery in July  2006 and with his full condition a state secret it is unclear  whether the 81-year-old will resume office.      'In the morning, 49 years of the revolution will be behind  us and the 50th year will symbolize half a century of heroic  resistance,' Castro said in a statement read on television. 'We  proclaim our pride in this record to the world.'      Cuba's National Assembly may decide on Castro's post as  head of state when it approves members of the executive Council  of State in March. But his brother Raul's call for more open  debate over problems has fueled speculation about the political  and economic future of the island.      His brother says Castro is lucid, consulted on major policy  decisions and has recovered sufficient strength that party  delegates support his nomination to run for a National Assembly  seat, a requirement for the presidency.      But Fidel Castro has hinted twice in recent statements he  will not cling on to power or his formal posts, suggesting he  will instead contribute with ideas drawn from his experience.     Castro has been nominated for the assembly but if he is too  ill, the assembly may formally appoint a successor. Fidel  Castro holds posts of president of the Council of State and  Council of Ministers and first secretary of the ruling  Communist Party.      Cuba watchers say a smooth transition of power already has  taken place under Raul Castro, who some believe is a more  practical manager who has begun talking about an open approach  to handling the economic problems, including more foreign  investment in the agriculture sector.

Hong Kong and Japanese  markets are closed on Tuesday for New Year holidays.            EQUITIES       NEW YORK - U.S. stocks fell on Monday, but the market managed  to make a modest advance in 2007 after gains in energy and  technology offset the dramatic sell-off in financials from the  mortgage market meltdown.      The Nasdaq Composite handily outperformed the Standard &  Poor's 500 index, thanks to the Nasdaq's heavy concentration of  technology components. Tech shares such as Apple Inc <AAPL.O> got  a lift from the weak dollar, which boosted overseas sales.  Meanwhile, the tech sector's low exposure to debt left it  unscathed from the freeze in credit markets.      For the year, the Nasdaq composite index rose 9.8 percent --  outshining the broad S&P 500, which gained 3.5 percent, and the  blue-chip Dow Jones industrial average, which climbed 6.4 percent.      For the fourth quarter, though, all three major U.S. stock  indexes had a loss.      On Monday, the Dow Jones industrial average <.DJI> fell  101.05 points, or 0.76 percent, to end at 13,264.82. The Standard  & Poor's 500 Index <.SPX> slipped 10.13 points, or 0.69 percent,  to 1,468.36. The Nasdaq Composite Index <.IXIC> dropped 22.18  points, or 0.83 percent, to 2,652.28.     The stock market will be closed on Tuesday for the New Year's  Day holiday. The U.S. bond market closed at 2 p.m. (1900 GMT) on  Monday.            - - - -      LONDON - Britain's FTSE 100 <.FTSE> index fell on Monday,  ending a year overshadowed by credit crisis and market turmoil  with gains of 3.8 percent -- its worst  performance since 2002.      The FTSE 100 index closed down 0.31 percent on the day at  6,456.9 in thin volumes and in a shortened session, before the  market closes on Tuesday for New Year's Day.      Heavyweight oil stocks were the worst performers on Monday,  with BP <BP.L> down 0.7 percent and Royal Dutch Shell <RDSa.L>  shedding 0.8 percent.      Miners tracked metal prices lower. BHP Billiton <BLT.L> and  Rio Tinto <RIO.L> fell 1 percent and Anglo American <AAL.L> shed  0.6 percent.      - - --      TREASURIES      - - - -      NEW YORK - U.S. government debt prices rose on Monday as  continued fears over the fallout from a global credit crisis once  again had investors selling higher-risk equities to buy into  safer-haven debt.      Month-end and year-end buying also helped support bonds,  although gains were limited by a report showing sales of existing  homes were brisker than expected in November. For details see  [ID:nN31498700].      The benchmark 10-year note <US10YT=RR> traded 12/32 higher in  price for a yield of 4.03 percent, from 4.08 percent late on  Friday, while the two-year note <US2YT=RR>_traded 3/32 higher for  a yield of 3.06 percent from 3.11 percent.      Trading ended early, at 2 p.m., (1900 GMT) before the New  Year holiday on Tuesday at the recommendation of the Securities  Industry and Financial Markets Association.      While bonds rose for a third straight session, prices overall  fell in December, with 10-year note yields posting their biggest  monthly rise since June and 2-year notes posting their biggest  monthly rise in yields since May.
