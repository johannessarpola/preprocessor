2008-01-01 00:01:05,"REITs hailed success, despite share price woes","    By Jennifer Hill      LONDON, Jan 1 (Reuters) - New property investment vehicles  were hailed a success on Tuesday, a year after their inception,  despite share prices tumbling around 40 percent.      More than 75 percent of Britain's major listed property  companies converted to real estate investment trust (REIT)  status during 2007.      There are currently 17 UK REITs with a total market  capitalisation of more than 25 billion pounds.      The REITs regime exempted eligible quoted property companies  from corporation tax, ending the double taxation of the sector  and making it attractive to investors who want to hold  tax-efficient indirect property investments in their portfolios.      A minimum percentage of investments in these closed-end  vehicles, typically around three-quarters, must be held in  rental-income producing real estate assets.      REITS must distribute 90 percent of their income, which  might be taxable in the hands of investors.      However, a torrid year for property share prices has  severely dented the investment trusts, wiping an average of  around 40 percent off their value.      The share price of all 17 UK REITs declined in value during  the year, according to data from the sector's campaign body  Reita.      Programme co-ordinator Dave Butler said: 'UK REITs have been  a real success, even despite significant market volatility which  has hit the property and many other stock market sectors in the  past year.      'Property is, and should be about, long-term investment for  income and growth, not just about short-term prices.      'The ability of REITs to provide long-term predictable  income is a major attraction for investors and the benefit of  liquidity, that is inherent in the REIT structure, is becoming  ever more obvious.'      The EPRA UK real estate index gave a total return of 35.5  percent per annum between 2003 and 2006 -- a figure that hit 48  percent in 2006.      Patrick Sumner, chairman of Reita, said low interest rates,  strong rental growth and the anticipation of UK REITs led prices  to overshoot, which led to 'some sharp profit-taking' at the  start of 2007.      'The fall in property share prices in 2007 has to be seen in  the context of strong, in retrospect excessive, performance in  the previous four years,' he said.      '2007 was just one year in an infinite future for the UK  REITs regime and we shouldn't judge it on the basis of one  rather extraordinary year.'      The body expects investors to return to the UK commercial  property market and yields to stabilise this year.      It also expects to see the launch of a number of new,  specialist REITs.

2008-01-01 00:03:48,"Malta joins euro zone","    By Chris Scicluna      VALLETTA, Jan 1 (Reuters) - The Mediterranean island of  Malta became the smallest member of the euro zone at the stroke  of midnight on Tuesday.      The former British colony of some 400,000 people qualified  for euro adoption after cutting its budget deficit from almost  10 percent of gross domestic product in 2003 to just over 2  percent.      It successfully overcame a last-minute struggle to rein in  inflation caused by galloping oil prices, and in November  Malta's annual inflation rate, at 2.9 percent, was running  slightly below the euro zone average of 3.1 percent.      A Euro Changeover Committee has successfully allayed fears  of inflation caused by euro adoption by reaching price-freeze  agreements with most importers and retailers.      Prime Minister Lawrence Gonzi and Malta Central Bank  Governor Michael Bonello crowned the moment by withdrawing euro  banknotes from an ATM.      'This is a historic day in the life of the country and if we  face up to the challenge and exploit the new opportunities which  monetary union offers, the step we are taking today should lead  to stronger, more sustainable economic growth,' said Bonello.      Malta and fellow Mediterranean island Cyprus became the 14th  and 15th countries to enter the euro zone, having joined the  European Union in 2004 with eight other countries.      Malta's exchange rate has been fixed at 0.43 lira to the  euro since it joined the European exchange rate mechanism in May  2005.      Euro zone states are Malta's most important trading partners  and euro adoption is seen benefiting its large tourism sector.      The opposition Labour Party, which had opposed EU membership  for Malta, backed euro adoption and a public information  campaign has been a widely acknowledged success.
