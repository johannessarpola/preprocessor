2008-01-01 01:05:03,"FEATURE-Golf-Time for tee on the Ponte Vecchio","    By Norman Dabell      FLORENCE, Italy, Jan 1 (Reuters) - Top golfers are used to  pursuing their handsome living in all parts of the globe but the  International Approach Championship provides an unusual setting  even for these hardened travellers.      Set in Florence, the event had an elite field of players  from 16 countries contesting a relatively meagre first prize of  $25,000 in a form of target golf from surely the sport's most  outlandish tee location -- the ancient Ponte Vecchio.      Built in 1345 and used for centuries by a wide variety of  traders, the bridge now attracts hundreds of thousands of  visitors who come to the historic Italian city every year.      According to local tradition, the concept of bankruptcy  originated on the Ponte Vecchio.      Traders who could no longer pay their taxes had the table on  which they sold their wares (il banco) broken (rotto) -- hence  banco-rotto (bankrupt) -- so they could trade no more.       Led by twice U.S. Masters champion Bernhard Langer, the  purveyors of golfing skills on view for the International  Approach Championship of 2007 in December, were in no danger of  having their staples of business broken by anyone -- except  themselves, perhaps, from frustration.      The tournament was conceived by Romano Boretti, who runs the  Conte of Florence clothing company and wanted do something  spectacular for Florence from the new millennium.      He thought of playing golf shots off the battlements of the  old bridge and over seven years the event grew in popularity to  become the international attraction it is now.            CAMERA FLASHES      The rules of the tournament were simple but provided a  fiendishly awkward golfing challenge which attracted a field  also including 2002 U.S. PGA champion Rich Beem to chilly  Florence while the rest of their counterparts were roasting  chestnuts by a roaring fire or soaking up the sun somewhere.      The players were challenged with hitting 20-ft-square greens  a distance of 50 to 140 metres on the River Arno from the famous  old bridge.      Difficult enough and not assisted by the hundreds of  pre-Christmas sightseers who often failed to observe traditional  golf etiquette of silence while the ball was struck.      Indeed many of the spectators even allowed their camera  flashes to go off during the golfers' back-swing, a crime  usually punished by a frogmarch off the course during a more  routine tournament.      Langer and his opponents barely turned a hair. The German is  the epitome of concentration and even a pre-event carriage ride  which went awry when the horse bolted a short distance failed to  upset his equilibrium.      He progressed to the semi-finals but took defeat there in  his stride.       'The family and me are taking a skiing holiday in Italy  before spending Christmas in Germany and we thought it would be  nice to stop off in Florence first. You always want to do well,  though, in anything you do,' he told Reuters.      Briton David Lynn and Swiss Andre Bossert reached the final  in temperatures of minus-three Celsius where the latter's  decision to wear three layers of clothes paid dividends with  eventual victory.      'I guess you can call me a bridge specialist now,' Bossert  told Reuters.
