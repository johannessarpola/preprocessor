2008-01-01 03:42:56,"TABLE-Sales under India's Market Stabilisation Scheme 2007/08","  Jan 1,Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India has issued bonds and  treasury bills under the Market Stabilisation Scheme (MSS)  totalling 1845.00 billion rupees since the current financial year  began on April 1.      The government has issued 91-day treasury bills worth 570.00  billion rupees, 182-days treasury bill worth 190.00 billion  rupees, 364-day treasury bills worth 180 billion and bonds worth  930 billion rupees.

Though it sells treasury bills under this scheme weekly, it  resumed selling dated securities from March 2006 after a gap of  nearly 18 months.      According to the central bank's website, the total  outstanding balance under the MSS stood at 1,626.65  billion rupees as on Dec 21, below a self-imposed limit of 2.35  trillion rupees.  -------------------------------------------------------------  Sale       Bond     Target sale  Cut-off       Wtd.

2008-01-01 03:45:29,"RPT-Benchmark index futures premium narrows slightly","    (Repeats story filed on Monday)      MUMBAI, Dec 31 (Reuters) - The premium on the benchmark Nifty  index futures narrowed slightly to the spot Nifty on the last day  of trading in 2007 as holiday mood gripped the trading community,  analysts said.      'People are on holiday,' said Sidharth Bhamre, derivatives  analyst with Angel Broking.      He said the Nifty's trading range would shift higher as more  inflows come in. 'We see the trading range shift from 5600-5700  to 5900-6100,' he said, adding that the Nifty could face  resistance at the 6150 level.      The premium on the Nifty January futures <NIFc1> was 24.35  points to the 50-share NSE index <.NSEI>, compared with 38.6  points on Friday.      The Nifty January futures closed up 44.65 points at 6162.95  while the spot index closed up 0.97 percent at 6138.6 points.      The large caps and the mid-caps would continue to drive the  market, analysts said. Short positions had been created in the  large-cap stocks, while people were long in mid-caps.      Buying put options against long futures would be an effective  hedging strategy, Bhamre said.      Data from the NSE site showed that among individual stock  futures Reliance Industries <RELInsc1> was the most active  followed by IFCI <IFCInsc1> in terms of traded volumes.

2008-01-01 03:51:04,"Obama widens lead over Clinton in Iowa poll","    DES MOINES, Dec 31 (Reuters) - Democratic presidential  candidate Barack Obama has widened his lead in Iowa over rivals  Hillary Clinton and John Edwards heading into Thursday's   caucuses, according to a poll by The Des Moines Register  released on Monday.      The Illinois senator was the choice of 32 percent of likely  Democratic caucusgoers, up from 28 percent in the Register's  previous poll in late November, the newspaper reported.      Clinton, a New York senator and former first lady, held  steady at 25 percent and Edwards, a former North Carolina  senator, was steady at 24 percent, the paper said.      No other Democrat received support from more than 6 percent  of likely caucusgoers, according to the poll.      The Register said its final survey before the first of the  crucial contests to decide the major party candidates for the  November 2008 election reflects continued fluidity in the race  even as the year-long campaign in the state nears an end.      Roughly a third of likely caucusgoers said they could be  persuaded to choose someone else before Thursday evening, the  paper said.      The telephone poll of 800 likely Democratic caucusgoers was  taken Dec. 27 to 30 and the margin of sampling error was plus  or minus 3.5 percentage points.
