2008-01-01 00:42:02,"UPDATE 2-Qualcomm barred from using Broadcom 3G patents"," (Recasts; changes headline; adds details from ruling, byline)      By Gina Keating      LOS ANGELES, Dec 31 (Reuters) - A federal judge in  California ruled on Monday that wireless chip maker Qualcomm  Inc <QCOM.O> must immediately stop selling third-generation, or  3G, WCDMA cellular chips that infringe on the Broadcom Corp  <BRCM.O> patents.      U.S. District Judge James Selna ruled, however, that  Qualcomm can keep selling some chips whose designs infringe  three patents held by rival Broadcom through January 2009.      Qualcomm also is restricted to selling only cellular chips  it was offering as of May 29, 2007 -- when a Santa Ana,  California jury found that it infringed on the Broadcom patents  -- and only to customers it had as of that date.      A Qualcomm spokeswoman said the company's attorneys were  reviewing the ruling and had no immediate comment.      In a statement, Broadcom General Counsel David Dull said  the company was 'pleased with today's ruling.'      'Broadcom should not have to compete against companies that  use Broadcom's own patented technology against us, and this  injunction puts a stop to Qualcomm doing just that,' Dull  said.      WCDMA mobile wireless technology provides much higher data  speeds to mobile and portable wireless devices than most North  American networks.      Qualcomm also must pay mandatory royalties to Broadcom for  the chips it sells during the 'sunset period' ending Jan. 31,  2009.      The judge set royalties at 6 percent for a patent covering  video compression for mobile phones and at 4.5 percent for  another covering simultaneous communications between different  types of networks.      He ordered Broadcom and Qualcomm to negotiate a royalty for  a third patent covering walkie-talkie-style technology or be  prepared to brief the court on an appropriate royalty at a Feb.  29, 2008 hearing.      Sprint Nextel Corp <S.N> plans to put that feature, which  it called QChat, in phones in the first quarter of 2008 using  Qualcomm chips.      Selna ruled that after the 'sunset' date, Qualcomm is  permanently barred from infringing the three Broadcom patents.      Broadcom had asked the judge to impose 18-month mandatory  license fees for two of the infringed patents for a limited set  of Qualcomm products and to bar Qualcomm from selling chips  used for the QChat feature.      Qualcomm had offered to pay three times the amount of a  'reasonable royalty' so that it could continue using Broadcom's  patented technology with no injunction.      Selna also ordered the companies to file a joint report  before the February hearing about how they plan to handle  Qualcomm's attempts to 'design around' the infringing chips.

The series will  look at all aspects of China's preparations for the Aug. 8-24  Games and will touch on political, economic, cultural and  environmental issues relating to the Olympics. Sports features  will profile medals prospects from around the world as well as  athletes for whom just getting to Beijing will be an achievement  in itself.       The series begins on Wednesday, Jan. 2, with a look at  China's state sports school system, where children as young as  six dream of becoming champions, and an interview with Athens  2004 marathon champion Stefano Baldini of Italy, who hopes to  recover from a disappointing 2007 and successfully defend his  title in Beijing.      Olympic features will initially run every Wednesday and will  carry pictures. Some will also have TV.    Keywords: ADVISORY       "
