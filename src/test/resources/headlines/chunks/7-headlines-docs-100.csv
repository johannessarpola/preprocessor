2008-01-01 03:28:25,"India rupee seen opening 2008 on firm footing","    MUMBAI, Jan 1 (Reuters) - The Indian rupee could appreciate  on Tuesday, helped by expectations of robust capital inflows in  2008, but traders said the central bank could intervene to check  the rupee's gains against the dollar.      * Data showed foreign investors bought more than $17 billion  of local equities in 2007, as at Dec. 28, including more than $1  billion in December, buoyed by expectations the economy will grow  close to 9 percent in the fiscal year that ends in March.      * A Reuters poll of 22 market participants in November  forecast that robust investment flows would help the rupee  strengthen against the dollar this year, and end 2008 at 37.63.      * The partially convertible rupee <INR=IN> ended at 39.41/42  per dollar, a shade stronger than the previous close of 39.42/43  and gained more than 12 percent from the previous year's close of  44.26.      * India is one of the few markets to open on Jan. 1, so  inflows from offshore are expected to be limited on Tuesday.   ---------------------------------------------------------------                         MARKET SNAPSHOT      Bombay Sensitive Index         <.BSESN>      Indian rupee (/$)              <INR=IN>   ---------------------------------------------------------------   (Reporting by C.J.

2008-01-01 03:41:34,"South Korea's Lee to invite North to inauguration","    SEOUL, Jan 1 (Reuters) - South Korean President-elect Lee  Myung-bak, who has pledged to act tough with North Korea, will  ask the communist neighbour to send a representative to his  inauguration in February, a Seoul news report said on Tuesday.      North Korean media have made no mention of Lee, the  conservative former mayor of Seoul who once ran the giant Hyundai  conglomerate's construction arm, since he won the presidency on  Dec. 19.      A member of Lee's advance team told the Yonhap news agency  Lee planned to send an envoy to North Korea to deliver an  invitation to attend his Feb. 25 inauguration.      '(The South) should send a special envoy to North Korea in  January so that an official at least from the deputy premier  level or higher can attend the presidential inauguration ceremony  in February,' Korea University Professor Nam Sung-wook, a senior  aide on North Korea policy, said in an interview.      Lee has pledged to review the North Korea policy of outgoing  President Roh Moo-hyun, criticised for being too soft on the  communist state whose government has continued to develop nuclear  weapons and maintained a dismal human rights record.      'There's no change in my belief that (the new government)  should offer dialogue with North Korea,' Nam said.      In his first news conference after the election, Lee called  on the North to give up its nuclear weapons and improve the way  it treats its citizens.      North Korea bristles at any criticism of its rights record,  widely seen as among the worst in the world. In the days  following his election victory five years ago, Roh apparently  angered Pyongyang by mentioning its human rights abuses.
