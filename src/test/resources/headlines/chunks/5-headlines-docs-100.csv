2008-01-01 02:36:49,"UPDATE 6-Colombian hostage rescue deal crumbles","  (Adds envoys left, helicopters staying in Colombia)      By Nelson Bocanegra      VILLAVICENCIO, Colombia, Dec 31 (Reuters) - A delicate  mission to free three hostages held by Colombian guerrillas  appeared to collapse on Monday as the government and rebel  leaders accused each other of trying to kill the deal.      The Venezuela-led plan to pick up two women hostages and a  child born to one of them in captivity has been repeatedly  delayed since last Thursday and rebel leaders said intense army  operations in the jungle region made it impossible for now.      'In these conditions it would put in grave risk the lives  of these people to free them,' the rebels said in a letter sent  to Venezuela's left-wing President Hugo Chavez, who had  negotiated the deal for the release of the three hostages.      Colombian President Alvaro Uribe rejected the allegation  and accused rebel commanders of inventing excuses.      The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC,  promised earlier this month to deliver the three to Chavez, and  he sent two helicopters to this town deep inside Colombia last  Friday to pick them up.      Chavez read out the FARC's letter explaining its failure to  say where the hostages were, and he accused Uribe of sabotaging  his rescue plan.      'Uribe went to dynamite the third phase of this operation,'  Chavez said, adding that independent reports also pointed to an  intensification of Colombian military activity in the area.      Foreign envoys, including former Argentine President Nestor  Kirchner, had gone to Colombia to help the mission but flew  back to Caracas on Monday night, although Chavez said his  helicopters would stay.      'Unless we are thrown out of Colombia, we will stay,' he  said, adding that he was in contact with the guerrillas and  still hoped they would tell him where the hostages were.      Uribe, a conservative who has clashed repeatedly with  Chavez, denied military operations had prevented the handover.      'The FARC terrorist group has no excuses. They have always  used excuses to deceive Colombia and now they want to deceive  the international community. They are lying,' he said in the  central city of Villavicencio, where the Venezuelan helicopters  waited to be dispatched for the handover.      He offered, however, to halt army patrols in an area  designated by the FARC once they reveal the location of their  captives.      The three hostages are Consuelo Gonzalez, Clara Rojas and  her son Emmanuel, who was fathered by a rebel fighter and is  thought to be four years old.           BORN IN REBEL CAMP      Uribe, whose father was killed by rebels, suggested the  FARC had backed off because they no longer have Rojas's son,  saying a child fitting his description was turned over to child  welfare authorities and is living in the capital city Bogota.  He said the child showed marks of torture.      Rojas was kidnapped during her 2002 vice presidential  campaign and Gonzalez, a former lawmaker, was taken in 2001.      In its letter to Chavez, the FARC said it was still  committed to handing over the hostages.      'As soon as we can find a place that offers us security, we  will be in touch to reactivate the mechanisms that will make  possible the safe return of Clara, Emmanuel and Consuelo,' it  said.      Chavez, a fierce critic of the United States, had earlier  speculated that radio interference by U.S. forces deployed in  Colombia to back its war against the FARC and drug traffic"

2008-01-01 02:41:36,"North Korea greets new year with nuclear silence","    By Jon Herskovitz      SEOUL, Jan 1 (Reuters) - North Korea gave no public  explanation on Tuesday for its failure to meet a nuclear  disarmament deadline, but promised a better standard of living  for the citizens of the destitute communist state.      Pyongyang, which uses newspaper editorials on New Year's Day  to lay out its policy priorities for the year to come, referred  only directly to its nuclear arms programme while focusing on  'building a prosperous nation'.      'The entire (communist) party, the whole country and all the  people should launch a general offensive to build an economic  power,' it said in an editorial jointly published in its official  media and carried in English by the official news agency.      Pyongyang failed to meet a Dec. 31 deadline to give a full  accounting of its nuclear arms programme, considered one of the  region's greatest security threats, and answer U.S. suspicions of  having a clandestine operation to enrich uranium for weapons.      '(North Korea) will continue to make earnest efforts for  stability on the Korean peninsula and peace in the world,' was  about the closest it came to addressing the matter.      Under a six-country deal, the reclusive North would receive 1  million tonnes of heavy fuel oil or equivalent aid and an end to  its status as an international pariah in exchange for starting to  take apart its plutonium-producing nuclear plant and providing a  list of its atomic activities.      The joint editorial called for modernising the North's  anaemic economy, which is weaker now than it was 20 years ago and  has been crippled by decades of mismanagement.            TINY PERCENTAGE      The North's GDP, estimated by Seoul's central bank at 21.2  trillion won ($22.6 billion), ranks close to that of war-torn Sri  Lanka and is less than 3 percent of the South Korean economy.      'The people's-living-first policy should be pursued,' the  joint editorial said in giving rare attention to the state's  consumer sector. North Korea pledged to build more housing and  develop light industries to make higher-quality consumer goods.      'This policy reflects our Party's firm determination and will  to make our people, who have pushed their way through trying  ordeal and hardship, lead an affluent and cultured life.'      North Korea pledged to develop ties with its southern  neighbour. It said it would boost the mining, railway and   chemical sectors while addressing its inability to grow enough  food to feed its 23 million people.      'At present there is no more urgent and important task than  solving the problem of food.'      In typical fashion, it lauded the pillars of the state, such  as its doctrine of juche (self-reliance) and the military-first  'songun' policy, as well as its revered leader, Kim Jong-il.      'The proud victories and successes we achieved last year in  the political, military, economic, cultural, diplomatic and all  other realms are brilliant fruition of leader Kim Jong-il's  outstanding strategy and tactics, his iron will and his tireless  leadership.'

2008-01-01 02:43:26,"China official Dec PMI falls to 55.3 vs 55.4 in Nov","    BEIJING, Jan 1 (Reuters) - China's official purchasing  managers' index fell to 55.3 in December from 55.4 in November,  the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing said on Tuesday.      The association compiles the index on behalf of the National  Bureau of Statistics.      A reading over 50 indicates an expansion of activity, while  one below 50 suggests contraction.      Zhang Liqun, a researcher with the Development Research  Centre, a think-tank that reports to China's cabinet, said that  the relative stability in the PMI was seasonal in nature and that  a recent easing in industrial defaultOutput had yet to show up in it.      'Industrial defaultOutput growth saw a modest easing in October and  November, but investment growth picked up, indicating an  acceleration in economic growth,' Zhang said in a commentary  released by the logistics and purchasing association.      'We still need to do further observation and analysis on the  seasonality of the PMI and its relationship to the rate of  industrial defaultOutput growth.'      The sub-index for input prices fell to 69.0 from 70.1 in  November, the association said, indicating a moderate  deceleration in such inflation.      The central bank raised interest rates six times and banks'  reserve requirements 10 times in 2007 in an effort to prevent  excess cash in the financial system from pouring into wasteful  investments and pushing up the prices of goods and assets.

2008-01-01 02:58:01,"Olympics-China exudes optimism despite critical new report","    By Ben Blanchard      BEIJING, Jan 1 (Reuters) - China exuded optimism on Tuesday  about the 2008 Beijing Olympics, saying its centuries of culture  and history would light up the world, even as organisers came  under renewed pressure to fulfil a media freedom pledge.      'We will show the world 5,000 years of splendid Chinese  history, the significant achievements of modern China and the  zeitgeist of the Chinese people,' said the Communist Party  mouthpiece, the People's Daily, in a New Year's Day editorial.      'This is the year that 1.3 billion sons and daughters of  China have been ardently expecting, the year when more of the  world's gaze will be fixed on China, the year that will be etched  into the history of the People's Republic,' it added.      While recognising that unprecedented challenges lay ahead for  the year as a whole, the editorial said that there would be far  more opportunities than challenges.      'We are standing at a new starting point in history,' it  said, just over eight months before the Games open in Beijing on  Aug. 8.      While the way ahead is expected to be anything but smooth  sailing, the editorial did not allude to looming problems such as  the pall of smog which still plagues Beijing or frequent foreign  criticism of China's human rights record.      Authorities are also well aware that groups such as Free  Tibet campaigners or China's growing band of domestically  dispossessed are hoping to use the Olympics to highlight their  complaints in front of a massive global audience.            PRESS HARASSMENT      The Foreign Correspondents' Club of China said on Monday that  reporters were still being subjected to harassment, interference  and even violence while doing their jobs, despite government  promises to grant total press freedom.      The group said there were 'repeated violations' of temporary  new regulations supposed to massively free up the reporting  environment, including in such sensitive regions as Tibet and  Xinjiang, although it added the new rules were a positive step.      Foreign journalists are now allowed to interview anyone  without first getting government permission, and to go pretty  much anywhere in China, although Tibet remains largely  off-limits. Domestic media are still tightly controlled.      'The FCCC hopes that as a lasting legacy of the Games, the  regulations will be made permanent, and will be fully implemented  nationwide, including in Tibet and Xinjiang,' it said in a  statement.      But China hit back at repeated censure of its human rights  situation by the United States, European Union and pressure  groups, releasing late on Monday via its official Xinhua news  agency a series of pieces lauding progress.      While Xinhua made no direct mention of the Games, Beijing has  been subject to particular criticism for forcibly evicting  residents to make way for Olympics-related projects, and for  detaining dissidents it fears will embarrass China.      'Human rights, as a concept, have become a constitutional  principle, a mainstream subject in the political life of both the  Party and the state,' it quoted Dong Yunhu, vice president of the  China Human Rights Research Association, as saying.
