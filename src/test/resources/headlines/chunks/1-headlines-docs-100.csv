2008-01-01 00:05:35,"WRAPUP 2-US candidates hone message; Huckabee pulls ad","    By Deborah Charles      PERRY, Iowa, Dec 31 (Reuters) - White House hopefuls honed  their closing messages and traded jabs over their records in  Iowa on Monday, three days before the state opens the  presidential nominating battle in a too-close-to-call race.      The leading contenders in both parties traded shots as a  tight Iowa campaign ticked down to the end. Republican Mike  Huckabee said he would not air an advertisement he prepared  attacking rival Mitt Romney -- then showed it to reporters.      Democrat Hillary Clinton said she was better suited to  tackle special interests in Washington than rival John Edwards,  a former North Carolina senator who has made that issue the  centerpiece of his campaign.      'It's easy to talk about taking on special interests,' the  New York senator and former first lady said in Keokuk, Iowa.  'I've taken on the oil companies and I intend to keep doing it.  It's something you don't have to do by yelling and screaming.  Save your energy. Get the job done.'      Polls show tight races in both parties in Iowa, which kicks  off the state-by-state battle to choose candidates in the  November presidential election.      A Reuters/C-SPAN/Zogby poll gave Clinton, seeking to be the  first woman U.S. president, a four-point lead among Democrats  over Edwards and Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, who were tied for  second.      Among Republicans, former Arkansas Gov. Huckabee narrowly  led former Massachusetts Gov. Romney by two points.      The Democratic caucuses -- in which people gather in  locations around the state to publicly declare support for  their choices -- begin at 6:30 p.m. CST/0030 GMT on Thursday  and Republicans start 30 minutes later. Results begin appearing  within a few hours.      All of the top Democrats argued they would be the most  electable in the November 2008 election, and targeted undecided  voters as they geared up mammoth operations to get out the vote  on Thursday.      'If you will stand with me on January 3 and caucus with me,  we can change the world,' Obama told a crowd in Perry in  central Iowa.      Polls showed many Iowans in both parties were undecided or  open to changing their minds. A Democratic caucus rule allowing  supporters of candidates who fail to gather 15 percent of  support in a given precinct to switch to another candidate  increased the uncertainty.           'FLUID RACE'      'There is a remarkable amount of fluidity in this race  right now and a lot of undecideds,' David Plouffe, Obama's  campaign manager, told reporters.      He said all signs pointed to a large Democratic turnout on  Thursday, which could be good for Obama and his effort to  attract first-time caucus participants. The record Democratic  turnout in 2004 was just more than 120,000.      Romney has spent the last few days airing ads attacking  Huckabee's record on immigration, taxes and crime in Arkansas.  Huckabee, a Baptist minister, has fired back with questions  about Romney's honesty and suitability for the White House.      But he said he decided not to air a television ad that he  prepared on Sunday in hopes of making the campaign more  positive but then showed a portion of it to reporters.      'I just feel that we need to change the tone of the  debate,' he told reporters, standing before a large poster that  said 'Enough is enough' and flanked by signs attacking Romney's  record.      Romney said the mixed message was confusing.      'On the one hand he says he wants to run "

2008-01-01 00:18:07,"UPDATE 2-Bush signs into law Sudan divestment measure"," (Adds further White House comment in paragraphs 7-9.)      By Jeremy Pelofsky      CRAWFORD, Texas, Dec 31 (Reuters) - U.S. President George  W. Bush on Monday signed into a law a measure aimed at allowing  states, local governments, mutual funds and pension funds to  divest from Sudan businesses, particularly its oil sectors.      Some 20 U.S. states have initiated divestment efforts  because of the conflict in Sudan's Darfur region, which has  taken some 200,000 lives and displaced some 2.5 million since  rebels took up arms against the government in 2003.      But the effort in Illinois was challenged in court so the  new law seeks to provide a legal framework for divestment from  companies involved in Sudan's oil industry, mineral extraction,  power production, and the production of military equipment.      Bush has called the deaths in the Darfur conflict genocide,  a charge the Sudanese government has rejected.      'My administration will continue its efforts to bring about  significant improvements in the conditions in Sudan through  sanctions against the government of Sudan and high-level  diplomatic engagement and by supporting the deployment of  peacekeepers in Darfur,' Bush said in a statement.      But at the same time, he argued some provisions of the new  law could interfere with his ability to conduct foreign policy  and therefore he would 'construe and enforce this legislation  in a manner that does not conflict with that authority.'      White House spokesman Scott Stanzel said the administration  would review divestment policies adopted by states and local  governments to ensure they are consistent with the president's  foreign policy and take action if necessary.      'If faced with an impediment to implementing a consistent,  national foreign policy, the executive branch will take all  appropriate and legal actions available,' he said.      But Stanzel stressed that Bush signed the measure because  'the president broadly agrees with the aim of the sponsors,  that doing business with Sudan should be discouraged.'      The administration's position drew a strong rebuke from the  spokeswoman for the chief sponsor of the new law, Sen. Chris  Dodd, a Connecticut Democrat and a long-shot 2008 presidential  hopeful.      'Up to this point, this administration's Sudan policy has  been sorely lacking,' said Dodd spokeswoman Jamie Radice. 'An  attempt by the president to step away from the letter and  spirit of this law would amount to an acquiescence in  genocide.'      The new law also requires the State and Treasury  Departments to report to Congress on the effectiveness of  sanctions on Sudan. Contractors doing business with the U.S.  government will have to certify that they are not involved in  those areas as well.      Bush signed the law at his Texas ranch where he was  spending a weeklong holiday.      The Save Darfur Coalition says the Sudanese government uses  up to 70 percent of its oil revenues, generated mainly through  foreign direct investment, to give arms and supplies to the  Janjaweed militia accused of the killings in Darfur.      Activists have pressed investors to divest their holdings  in companies such as Malaysia's state-owned Petronas [PETR.UL],  India's Oil and Natural Gas Corp Ltd <ONGC.BO>, and PetroChina  Co Ltd <0857.HK>, whose parent company, China National  Petroleum Corp, is helping Sudan drill for oil.
